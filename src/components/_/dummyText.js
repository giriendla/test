                <p>
                    No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? She's just trying to keep you respectable. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Marty, such a nice name.
                </p>
                <h2>Heading Two</h2>
                <p>
                    Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Who's are these? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.
                </p>
                <h3>Heading Three</h3>
                <p>
                    Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? I followed you. Ah. Whoa. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Right.
                </p>
                <h4>Heading Four</h4>
                <p>
                    On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. You know what I do in those situations? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? George. George.
                </p>
                <h5>Heading Five</h5>
                <p>
                    I have to tell you about the future. Nothing. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Are those my clocks I hear? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

                <h6>Heading Six</h6>
                <p>
                    Ah. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. What, I don't get what happened. You do? I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.
